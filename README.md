Final Project

MSCH-C220 Game Jam, November 2022

## Time for Dinner
We interpreted the theme with the use of hot dogs as our point system.

## Game Play
Objective is to clear all 4 levels while collesting hot dogs for points.
Move left A
Move right D
Jump W

## Impediments
We struggled with collaborating in github. Most of our problems were problems with merging.

## Implementation
We added hot dogs as the pint system.
Rats and hungy people as enemies.
